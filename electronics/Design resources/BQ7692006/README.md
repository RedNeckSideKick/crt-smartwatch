The [BQ76920](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/BQ7692006PWR/5177837) Battery Monitor IC has a [support/training](https://www.ti.com/product/BQ76920#support-training) page supplied by TI. This along with documentation supplied in the datasheet gives implementation specifications. It will be operating with a 3s LiPo battery which produces between 11.16 V at minimum safe charge to 12.6 V at maxium safe charge. Charging will not occur in this device, only discharging. Low-side switching is used for simplicity (and because the [BQ76200 High-Side N-Channel FET Driver](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/texas-instruments/BQ76200PW/5803293) recommended for use with this series of chips is out of stock everywhere right now).

This IC requires an external microcontroller to operate, and contains a LDR (low-dropout regulator) supplying 3.3v (-06 model) with a current limit of about 38 mA on the `REGOUT` pin. I2C communication is required to enable output through the switching MOSFET(s), but the low current limit of the onboard LDR means this chip is insufficient to power the ESP32 microcontroller which needs no less than 500 mA to operate at full power with its antenna. The final design is likely to have a supplementary low-power microcontroller SoC for managing the battery and enabling power output, potentially a Microchip PIC microcontroller. Since the ground planes for the battery monitor microcontroller and the ESP32 (connected to a separate regulator on the switched side of the battery) would not be directly connected due to the current sensing resistor and switching MOSFET(s), communication may not be reliable for methods that rely on comparing voltages to `GND` and `VCC` (i.e. TTL/CMOS logic). To combat this, a pair of full-duplex RS-422 trancievers could be utilized to transmit and recieve across the power plane difference using two differential pairs, with each tranciever powered using the same supply as its corresponding microcontroller.
