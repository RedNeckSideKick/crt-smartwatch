It provides basic part selection and other considerations for use in a [LM2576T-5.0](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/LM2576T-5.0%2fNOPB/LM2576T-5.0%2fNOPB-ND/212636) switching regulator application.

The design was generated using the following parameters:

Parameter | Value
-|-
`Vin` Min.  | 11.12 V
`Vin` Max.  | 12.60 V
`Vout`      | 5.0 V
`Iout` Max. | 2.5 A
Max Ambient Temp. | 30Â°C
Optimization | Balanced

Final part selection will most certainly differ from given in the reference design, but with reference drawn from the design as well as the [LM25XX Series Datasheet](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm2576hv.pdf?HQS=dis-dk-null-digikeymode-dsf-pf-null-wwe&ts=1623086956737).
