In order to accomodate for the ground plane difference between the two microcontrollers (the PIC32 used for the power sequencing and the ESP32 used for everything else) I am using a pair of full-duplex RS-422/485 transcievers which use a differential pair to send signals instead of relying on voltage levels relative to `GND` and `VCC`. The chip I am using is the [ISL83488](https://www.renesas.com/us/en/document/dst/isl83483-isl83485-isl83488-isl83490-isl83491-datasheet), and I also referenced this [Analog Devices Implementation Guide](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/application-notes/AN-960.pdf) in regards to line termination.
