A basic linear regulator is used to step down from 5 V to 3.3 V for the ESP32 and other devices that need that voltage level on the outside of the battery circuit. The [MCP1727-3302E](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/microchip-technology/MCP1727T-3302E-SN/8638127) is a simple 5 V to 3.3 V linear regulator that can source up to 1.5 A. The device additionally has a `PWRGD` output which operates with a delay controlled by a capacitor; more details about this functionality are available in [the datasheet](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/MCP1727-1.5A-Low-Voltage-Low-Quiescent-Current-LDO-Regulator-20001999C.pdf). This may be of limited use for the battery management microcontroller without an isolator of some sorts to account for the ground plane difference.

Texas Instruments has provided a [PDF document](https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva079/slva079.pdf) explaining many of the terms that relate to Low-Dropout Regulators (LDRs) such as the one mentioned above. I referenced this to better understand what was meant by dropout voltage and quiescent current.
